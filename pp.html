Delegates who do this module find how effective each one of our syllabuses is a problem solver in some of the issues we face as parents.</p>

				<h2>Understanding Childhood Development</h2>
                <p>Childhood development will look at the psychological, emotional and physical needs of our children. We will look at the fetus to early infancy and to look more analytically at the developmental stages of early childhood and their socialization potential. We will then look more closely at the developmental processes of adolescence and how some of the rudimentary changes occur in their lives. Young adults and parent who do this course find that their ability to deal with changes either by growing up are by being parents shapes a new attitude and approach to understanding the developmental changes that happen during these turbulent times. By the end of this module youngsters and parents will provide themselves with tools to ensure a more positive outlook in their approach and methods in which they find themselves in.</p>

				<h2>Family, Friends and Relationships</h2>
                <p>This section will concentrate on the family structure and function of everyday life. The family is the cornerstone of any society and without it society does not function harmoniously as it should. We will delve into the issues parents face in a relationship and how to cope or survive them, when the relationship has terminated and we still need to be parents or carers. We will look at why relationships fail and what we can do to repair them if we are still together or apart. We will look at the social aspects children go through once their parents or carers split and what sort of help and are available to get us through each day as well as the child.</p>
